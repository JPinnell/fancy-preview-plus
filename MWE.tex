	\section{A Foregone Conclusion}
	
	This document presents a brief, scientific analysis of the Cambridge University Golf Club's (CUGC) comprehensive victory over their esteemed rivals from Oxford. The results, as you will see, were never in doubt.	\footnote{The main purpose is actually to showcase fancy-preview-plus. Hover over the references to see a preview of them without having to scroll to the relevant part of the document and potentially lose your place (amazing I know)!}
	
	\subsection{The Fundamental Formula for Victory}
	The outcome can be described by the simple, elegant formula shown in Equation~\ref{eq:obvious}. Hover over the reference to see the mathematical ``proof''.
	\begin{equation}
		\text{Victory Margin} = (\text{Talent}_{\text{CUGC}})^\infty - (\text{Hope}_{\text{Oxford}})^0
		\label{eq:obvious}
	\end{equation}
	
	\subsection{Iconographic Evidence}
	Further proof can be seen in the majestic emblem of the club itself, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:logo}. Its inherent quality is a clear precursor to victory. Hover over the reference ``\ref{fig:logo}'' for a glorious preview.

	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{A Provable, Peer-Reviewed Theorem}
	Finally, we present Theorem~\ref{thm:truth}, a universal principle now supported by extensive research \cite{Pinnell2025}.
	\begin{theorem}[The Principle of Light Blue Supremacy]
		In any given University Golf Match, the probability of a CUGC victory, $P(V_{CUGC})$, asymptotically approaches 1. For the 136th match, this theorem was rigorously proven. \label{thm:truth}
	\end{theorem}
	
	The evidence is, as you can see, conclusive. GDBO.
